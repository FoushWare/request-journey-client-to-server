## What Were The Problems We Solved?

### Problem #1: No Task Documentation
**Before:** 149 GitHub issues existed but had no actionable task files  
**Solution:** Created 54 comprehensive task files with:
- Clear objectives and descriptions
- 10-15 sub-tasks each
- Acceptance criteria
- Code examples
- Security considerations
- Learning resources

### Problem #2: Issues Not Mapped to Development Tasks
**Before:** Issues scattered across categories without clear action plans  
**Solution:** Created issue-to-task mapping showing:
- Which directory each issue belongs to
- Task file naming convention
- Priority and effort estimates
- Dependencies and relationships

### Problem #3: No Guidance for Developers
**Before:** Developers didn't know where to start  
**Solution:** Each task file includes:
- Step-by-step sub-tasks
- Acceptance criteria (definition of done)
- Technology stack and tools
- Best practices and security guidelines
- Real-world code examples
