# Task: Kubernetes - Comprehensive Coverage Checklist

**Related Issue:** #138  
**Prerequisites:** All previous Kubernetes tasks  
**Estimated Time:** Reference/Checklist task  
**Notes App Context:** Comprehensive checklist to ensure all Kubernetes concepts are covered in the learning path, serving as a reference and gap analysis tool

---

## Learning Objectives

- Verify coverage of all Kubernetes concepts
- Identify any gaps in learning path
- Use as reference for Kubernetes mastery
- Ensure production-ready knowledge
