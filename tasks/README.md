## Task Numbering System

Tasks are numbered sequentially within each category:

- `docker/task-001.md`, `docker/task-002.md`, etc.
- `kubernetes/task-001.md`, `kubernetes/task-002.md`, etc.

Each task number corresponds to a specific GitHub issue and builds on previous tasks.

## Task Structure

Each task file follows a comprehensive structure:

1. **Header**: Task name, related issue, prerequisites, estimated time
2. **Learning Objectives**: What you'll learn from this task
3. **Theory Section**: Comprehensive explanation of concepts
4. **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Detailed, actionable steps
5. **Notes App Specifics**: How it applies to the Notes App
6. **OpenShift Notes**: OpenShift-specific instructions (where applicable)
7. **Verification**: How to verify completion
8. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
9. **Best Practices**: Security, performance, operational tips
10. **Next Steps**: Link to next task

## How to Use Tasks

### Getting Started

1. **Read the Learning Path**: Start with `docs/LEARNING_PATH.md` to understand the overall journey
2. **Review Prerequisites**: Each task lists prerequisites - complete them first
3. **Follow Sequentially**: Tasks build on each other, so follow the sequence
4. **Verify Completion**: Always complete verification steps before moving on

### Working Through Tasks

1. **Read the Theory**: Understand concepts before implementation
2. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure you have everything needed
3. **Follow Steps**: Execute steps carefully, understanding each one
4. **Test with Notes App**: Always verify the Notes App works after each task
5. **Document Learning**: Take notes on what you learned
6. **Ask Questions**: Use the mentorship guide if you're stuck

## Task Status Tracking

### Recommended Tracking Method

1. **Checklist in Each Task**: Use the checklist at the end of each task
2. **Learning Journal**: Document what you learned from each task
3. **Git Commits**: Commit code changes after each task
4. **Progress Log**: Track which tasks you've completed

### Task States

- **Not Started**: Haven't begun the task
- **In Progress**: Currently working on the task
- **Completed**: Task finished and verified
- **Blocked**: Stuck and need help

## Prerequisites

### General Prerequisites

- Basic Linux command line knowledge
- Git version control
- Text editor (VS Code recommended)
- Terminal/command prompt access

### Phase-Specific Prerequisites

Each phase lists specific prerequisites. Check the Learning Path document for details.

## Getting Help

### When You're Stuck

1. **Review Troubleshooting Section**: Each task includes common issues
2. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure you completed all prerequisites
3. **Review Theory Section**: Re-read concepts you might have missed
4. **Ask Your Mentor**: Use the mentorship guide for guidance
5. **Search Documentation**: Check official documentation links in tasks

### Common Issues

- **Task not working**: Check prerequisites and troubleshooting section
- **Don't understand concept**: Re-read theory section, ask mentor
- **Verification failing**: Review steps, check logs, verify configuration
- **Stuck for too long**: Set time limit (30-60 min), then ask for help

## Notes App Context

All tasks are contextualized for the Notes App:

- **Frontend**: Next.js application with login, create note, view notes, logout
- **Backend**: Express API with JWT authentication, user management, notes CRUD
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB storing users and notes

Every task includes specific instructions for the Notes App and verification steps that test actual application functionality.

## OpenShift Support

Tasks that involve Kubernetes include OpenShift-specific instructions:

- `oc` command equivalents
- OpenShift-specific concepts (Projects, Routes, etc.)
- Differences and considerations

If you're learning OpenShift, follow the OpenShift notes in each task.

## Best Practices

### While Working Through Tasks

1. **Read First**: Read the entire task before starting
2. **Understand Why**: Don't just follow steps - understand why
3. **Test Frequently**: Test Notes App after each major step
4. **Document**: Take notes on what you learn
5. **Experiment**: Try variations to deepen understanding
6. **Review**: Review completed tasks periodically

### Code Quality

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow best practices mentioned in tasks
- Comment your code
- Use version control (Git)
- Commit frequently with meaningful messages
