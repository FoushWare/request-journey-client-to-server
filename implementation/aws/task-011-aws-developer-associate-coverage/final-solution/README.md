# Final Solution: AWS Developer Associate Coverage

This directory contains reference materials for AWS Developer Associate coverage.

## Purpose

This is a **reference and checklist task**, not an implementation task. Use it to:
- Track AWS service coverage
- Ensure Free Tier compliance
- Prepare for AWS certification
- Reference AWS services

## Coverage Checklist

See the task file: `tasks/aws/task-011-aws-developer-associate-coverage.md`

## AWS Free Tier Notes

All implementations should use AWS Free Tier resources:
- EC2: t2.micro or t3.micro (750 hours/month)
- S3: 5 GB storage, 20K GET requests
- RDS: db.t2.micro (750 hours/month)
- Lambda: 1M requests/month
- And more...

## How to Use

1. Review the checklist in the task file
2. Check off AWS services as you implement them
3. Verify Free Tier usage
4. Use as certification prep guide

## No Implementation Code Needed

Since this is a reference task, no starter/final-solution code is required. The checklist in the task file serves as the "solution".
