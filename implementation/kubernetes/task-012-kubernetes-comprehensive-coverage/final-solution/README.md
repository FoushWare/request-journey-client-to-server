# Final Solution: Kubernetes Comprehensive Coverage

This directory contains reference materials for comprehensive Kubernetes coverage.

## Purpose

This is a **reference and checklist task**, not an implementation task. Use it to:
- Track your learning progress
- Identify knowledge gaps
- Reference Kubernetes concepts
- Ensure comprehensive coverage

## Coverage Checklist

See the task file: `tasks/kubernetes/task-012-kubernetes-comprehensive-coverage.md`

## How to Use

1. Review the checklist in the task file
2. Check off items as you complete them
3. Identify areas needing more practice
4. Use as quick reference for concepts

## No Implementation Code Needed

Since this is a reference task, no starter/final-solution code is required. The checklist in the task file serves as the "solution".
