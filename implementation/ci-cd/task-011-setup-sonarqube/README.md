# Task 011: Setup SonarQube - Implementation Directory

This directory contains implementation examples for setting up SonarQube (both Cloud and self-hosted options).

## Structure

- `starter/`: Starting point (empty, ready for configuration)
- `final-solution/`: Complete solution with:
  - `docker-compose.yml`: Self-hosted SonarQube setup
  - `sonar-project.properties.example`: Example configuration file
  - `README.md`: Setup instructions

## Usage

1. Review the task: `tasks/ci-cd/task-011-setup-sonarqube.md`
2. Choose SonarCloud (easier) or self-hosted option
3. Follow the task instructions
4. Reference `final-solution/` if you get stuck

## Notes

- SonarCloud is recommended for beginners
- Self-hosted requires Docker and more setup
- Both options work the same for analysis
