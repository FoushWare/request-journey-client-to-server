# Capsule Projects

Capsule projects are **independent, real-world projects** where you research and implement solutions on your own. Unlike the step-by-step tasks, these projects challenge you to:

- Research technologies and approaches
- Make architectural decisions
- Solve problems independently
- Build complete applications from scratch

## Philosophy

These projects simulate real-world scenarios where:
- You receive requirements, not step-by-step instructions
- You need to research and learn independently
- You make decisions about technology choices
- You encounter and solve problems on your own

## Available Projects

1. **E-commerce App** - Shopping cart, payments, inventory management
2. **Blog Platform** - Posts, comments, user management, categories
3. **Todo/Project Management** - Tasks, teams, deadlines, kanban board
4. **Real-time Chat** - WebSocket messaging, rooms, presence
5. **API Gateway** - Microservices routing, authentication, rate limiting

## Project Structure

Each capsule project contains:

```
{project-name}/
├── starter/
│   └── [Initial codebase with basic structure]
├── final-solution/
│   └── [Complete implemented solution]
├── hints/
│   └── [Progressive hints if you get stuck]
├── README.md
│   ├── Project requirements
│   ├── Learning objectives
│   ├── Technology stack
│   ├── Implementation approach
│   └── Success criteria
└── solution-walkthrough.md
    ├── Architecture decisions
    ├── Implementation steps
    ├── Key challenges and solutions
    └── Best practices applied
```

## How to Use

### Step 1: Choose a Project

Select a project that interests you and matches your learning goals.

### Step 2: Read the Requirements

Read the `README.md` file thoroughly:
- Understand the project requirements
- Review the learning objectives
- Check the technology stack
- Understand success criteria

### Step 3: Start with Starter Code

Copy the `starter/` directory to your working directory:
- This gives you a basic structure to begin with
- You don't need to write everything from scratch
- Focus on implementing the requirements

### Step 4: Research and Implement

- Research technologies you need
- Make architectural decisions
- Implement features step by step
- Test your implementation

### Step 5: Use Hints (If Stuck)

If you get stuck:
1. Try to solve it yourself first
2. Check the `hints/` directory
3. Start with vague hints, progress to specific ones
4. Only check final-solution as a last resort

### Step 6: Review Solution

After completing (or if really stuck):
- Review `final-solution/` to see a complete implementation
- Read `solution-walkthrough.md` to understand the approach
- Compare your solution with the provided one
- Learn from differences

## Best Practices

1. **Don't rush**: Take time to understand requirements
2. **Research first**: Learn about technologies before implementing
3. **Make decisions**: Choose your own approach, don't just copy
4. **Document**: Write down your decisions and why you made them
5. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure your solution works correctly
6. **Learn from differences**: Compare your solution with the final one

## When to Use Capsule Projects

- After completing several task categories
- When you want to practice independent problem-solving
- To build a portfolio of projects
- To prepare for real-world scenarios
- When you want a break from step-by-step learning

## Relationship to Tasks

- **Tasks**: Step-by-step learning with detailed instructions
- **Capsule Projects**: Independent projects with minimal guidance

Both are valuable - tasks teach you concepts, capsule projects help you apply them independently.
