## Success Criteria

Your project is complete when:

- [ ] Users can create and manage tasks
- [ ] Projects can be created and organized
- [ ] Kanban board works correctly
- [ ] Tasks can be assigned to team members
- [ ] Filtering and search work
- [ ] Application is containerized
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is set up
- [ ] Application is deployed
- [ ] UI is intuitive and responsive
- [ ] Real-time features work (if implemented)

## Getting Started

1. **Review the starter code**: Check `starter/` directory
2. **Design your data model**: Plan tasks, projects, users, teams
3. **Start with tasks**: Build core task functionality first
4. **Add projects**: Organize tasks into projects
5. **Build Kanban**: Implement drag-and-drop board
6. **Use hints**: Check `hints/` if stuck
7. **Review solution**: Compare with `final-solution/` after completion

## Tips

- Start with simple task list
- Add complexity gradually
- Focus on core features first
- Test drag and drop early
- Consider real-time from the start
- Plan for scalability

## Time Estimate

- **Beginner**: 40-60 hours
- **Intermediate**: 25-40 hours
- **Advanced**: 15-25 hours
