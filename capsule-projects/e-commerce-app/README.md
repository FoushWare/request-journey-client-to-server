   - Implementing business logic
   - Database design and optimization

2. **DevOps Practices**
   - Containerizing multi-service applications
   - Setting up CI/CD pipelines
   - Managing environment configurations
   - Monitoring and logging

3. **Security**
   - Secure authentication and authorization
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Payment data handling
   - API security

4. **Architecture**
   - Microservices vs monolith decisions
   - Database design patterns
   - API design
   - Scalability patterns

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Application
1. Set up project structure
2. Implement user authentication
3. Create product catalog
4. Build shopping cart functionality

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Implement checkout process
2. Add order management
3. Create admin panel (optional)
4. Add search and filtering

### Phase 3: DevOps Integration
1. Containerize application
2. Set up database
3. Configure environment variables
4. Add monitoring and logging

### Phase 4: Deployment
1. Set up CI/CD pipeline
2. Deploy to cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure)
3. Configure domain and SSL
4. Set up backups

## Success Criteria

Your project is complete when:

- [ ] Users can register and log in
- [ ] Products can be browsed and searched
- [ ] Shopping cart works correctly
- [ ] Checkout process is functional
- [ ] Orders are stored and trackable
- [ ] Application is containerized
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is set up
- [ ] Application is deployed and accessible
- [ ] Code is well-documented
- [ ] Security best practices are followed

## Getting Started

1. **Review the starter code**: Check `starter/` directory for initial structure
2. **Plan your architecture**: Decide on tech stack and structure
3. **Start with authentication**: Build user management first
4. **Iterate**: Add features incrementally
5. **Use hints**: Check `hints/` if you get stuck
6. **Review solution**: Compare with `final-solution/` after completion

## Tips

- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Focus on core features first
- Test each feature before moving on
- Use version control (Git)
- Document your decisions
- Don't skip security considerations

## Time Estimate

- **Beginner**: 40-60 hours
- **Intermediate**: 25-40 hours
- **Advanced**: 15-25 hours

Good luck! 🚀
