# Hint 1: Getting Started

This is a gentle hint to help you begin. Try to solve it yourself first!

**Hint**: Start by understanding the requirements. Break down the project into smaller, manageable pieces. What's the core functionality you need to build first?

**Next Steps**: 
- Review the project requirements carefully
- Identify the minimum viable product (MVP)
- Plan your database schema
- Set up your project structure

Remember: It's okay to start simple and add complexity later!
