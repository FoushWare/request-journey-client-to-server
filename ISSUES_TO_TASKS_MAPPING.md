## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1:** Create tasks for Networking (10) - Foundation layer
2. **Phase 2:** Create tasks for Backend (10) and Frontend (10) - Core services
3. **Phase 3:** Create tasks for Docker (10) and Kubernetes (11) - Container orchestration
4. **Phase 4:** Create tasks for CI/CD (20) and Security (10) - DevOps infrastructure
5. **Phase 5:** Create tasks for remaining categories

## How to Use This Mapping

1. **For Development:** Pick an issue number, find its mapped task file
2. **For Tracking:** Update task status as work progresses
3. **For Planning:** Use issue groups to organize work by phases
4. **For Documentation:** Each task links back to GitHub issue

## File Naming Convention

Tasks are organized by category and numbered sequentially:
- `tasks/networking/task-001.md` → Issue #1
- `tasks/microservices/backend-001.md` → Issue #11
- `tasks/integration/frontend-001.md` → Issue #21
- `tasks/ci-cd/ci-cd-001.md` → Issue #41
- etc.

**Status:** Mapping complete, task creation in progress  
**Next Action:** Create task files for all 149 issues
