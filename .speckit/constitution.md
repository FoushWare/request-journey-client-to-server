## Project Principles & Governance

### Core Values
- **Spec-Driven Development**: Define specifications before implementation
- **Clarity First**: Clear requirements prevent misunderstandings
- **Collaboration**: DevOps learning through hands-on implementation
- **Quality**: High code quality, security, observability standards
- **Scalability**: Designed for distributed, production-grade systems

### Project Vision
Building a full-stack microservices platform with complete DevOps infrastructure, demonstrating enterprise-grade patterns for logging, monitoring, security, and deployment.

### Code Quality Standards
- All code must be reviewed and tested
- Documentation required for all components
- Security scanning before deployment
- Performance benchmarking for critical paths

### Security Principles
- Zero-trust network architecture
- Encrypted data in transit and at rest
- Regular security audits and updates
- Compliance with industry standards

### Observability Requirements
- Structured logging for all services
- Distributed tracing across microservices
- Metrics collection and monitoring
- Alerting for anomalies and errors

### Deployment Standards
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)
- Container-based (Docker)
- Orchestration (Kubernetes)
- GitOps-driven deployments

### Success Criteria
- All 149 GitHub issues resolved
- Full test coverage (>80%)
- Documentation complete
